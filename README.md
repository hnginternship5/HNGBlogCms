# Ziki

We are to collaborate to create the following:
  - The blogging experience
  - Authentication (which should only be possible via google or via facebook, there is no native auth)
  - Commenting
  - Customisation of the sidebar
  - Uploading of the profile image
  
This app is to be created *without a database*! The posts are to be stored as markdown files.*
_There should be a settings.json file that saves other things like auth token and so on.
