# Ziki

Each team is to come up with 2 different themes for the site. The teams will have to collaborate to create the following:
  - The blogging experience
  - Authentication (which should only be possible via google or via facebook, there is no native auth)
  - Commenting
  - Customisation of the sidebar
  - Uploading of the profile image
  
*This app is to be created *without a database*! The posts are to be stored as markdown files.*
_There should be a settings.json file that saves other things like auth token and so on.
To design their themes, each team will need a designer - and not all designers right now are getting positive comments from me. Please recruit the designers I am currently liking their work into your team._
